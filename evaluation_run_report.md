# XAI / AI Risk Dashboard

This project demonstrates the use of **explainable AI (XAI)** tools to evaluate AI risk in model outputs, with a focus on:

- **Explainability**
- **Transparency**
- **Accountability**

The project aligns with **Responsible AI** practices and the **NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF)**, specifically supporting the **Measure** and **Manage** functions.

---

## Project Objectives

- Apply SHAP and/or LIME explainability tools to analyze model outputs.
- Identify potential risks such as:
    - Feature over-reliance
    - Sensitivity to inputs
    - Lack of robustness
- Visualize results in an understandable dashboard format.
- Demonstrate alignment with Responsible AI principles and NIST AI RMF.

## Data

- **Dataset:** `data/xai_test_dataset.csv`
- **Content:** Example dataset suitable for model explainability (I will generate a starter version).

---

## Methodology

1. Prepare test dataset.
2. Train simple model (or use pre-trained model if desired).
3. Apply SHAP and/or LIME explainability analysis.
4. Visualize key insights in Jupyter Notebook.
5. Document findings and risk observations in `evaluation_run_report.md`.

---

## Results (to be updated after running evaluation)

- Key explainability insights.
- Identified risks or concerns.
- Recommendations for mitigation.

---

## Tools Used

- **SHAP** Python library
- **LIME** (optional, as complement to SHAP)
- **scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib** / **Seaborn**
- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## Alignment to AI Governance & Policy

- **AI RMF "Measure" Function:** Explainability metrics used to assess model transparency.
- **AI RMF "Manage" Function:** Documented actionable insights to manage AI risks.
- **Transparency:** Visual presentation of model behavior.
- **Actionable Feedback:** Recommendations provided for AI risk mitigation.
